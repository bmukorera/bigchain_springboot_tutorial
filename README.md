#### **JAVA SPRINGBOOT BIGCHAINDB**

In this example we look at how you can integrate your java springboot application the the blockchain database BigchainDB.

Before running the application you will need to setup a test instance of BigchainDB on your local machine and run on your local machine.

#### **SETUP BIGCHAINDB**

Before installing BigchainDB make sure you have on your machine installed:

*Docker* and *Docker Compose* 

1. git clone https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb.git
2. cd bigchain
3. make run

This will install your bigchaindb node and once it has finished installing it will be available on port 9984.

Thats it for setting up BigchainDB. 

You can checkout this repository and run the unit test to test the applicaition.

To check requests in your BigchainDB you can use MongoDB Compass
